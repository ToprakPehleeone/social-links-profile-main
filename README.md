## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Used ':hover' and ':focus' attributes to add little dynamisim to my project. Getting links to fit the container did required me to research but the solution was simple. In general this was a nice practice to write HTML and CSS. 


### Continued development

I feel like i need to focus more on making responsive designs and writing cleaner, more meaningful and more accessible code. It will come in time i think thanks to feedbacks.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16555644/how-can-i-make-a-link-inside-a-div-fill-the-entire-space-inside-the-div) - This helped me for fitting links in a container. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://quentin-bellanger.com/blog/keyboard-navigation/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand keyboard accesibility I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
